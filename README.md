# CODE-GUESSER-GAME

# Project Overview
"Code Guesser is a challenging and engaging trivia-style game where players must correctly identify or complete snippets of code from various programming languages. The game features a unique mechanic where the player's 'life' (or time/health bar) slowly depletes over time, simulating corrosion. Incorrect answers result in additional point/life deductions, adding urgency and risk to the gameplay."
Game Objectives,"The primary objective is to enhance the player's coding knowledge in a fun, entertaining way. Players aim to achieve the highest possible score by correctly identifying code snippets before their life/time runs out."

# Win/Lose Conditions
Win/Lose Conditions,* Win Condition: There is no traditional 'win' state that ends the game (unless all pre-loaded questions are completed). Winning is defined by achieving a high score and surviving for the longest duration possible. The game may implement a leaderboard feature to track competitive success. * Lose Condition: The game ends immediately when the player's Life/Health Bar reaches zero (due to a combination of time-based corrosion and incorrect answers).

# How to Play

Start: 

The game begins when the player clicks the "Start" button.
Life Corrosion: Immediately upon starting, a life or health bar begins to slowly deplete (corrode) at a steady rate. This acts as a global timer for the current round.
Question Display: A code snippet (the "Code to Guess") is displayed along with several multiple-choice answers or input fields.

Scoring:
Correct Answer: The player earns a set amount of points (e.g., +10 points) and a small amount of time/life may be restored.
Incorrect Answer: The player loses a significant number of points (e.g., -10 points) and incurs a large deduction from their Life Bar, accelerating the loss condition.

Game End: 
The game ends when the Life Bar reaches zero. The player's final score is recorded and displayed on the High Score screen.
